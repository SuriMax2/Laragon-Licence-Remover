# Laragon-Licence-Remover

Removes the annoying license stuff that Laragon puts in the free version.
For a long time, Laragon has forced three extra clicks and opens a browser tab every time we try to start or stop a service just for some changes to apply.

Build the dllmain.cpp file as a .dll using any Visual Studio project.
Once compiled, rename the output file to version.dll and place it next to laragon.exe.
The next time you open Laragon, a single license warning will be shown. Just press “VERIFY” license, and you’re done.
